If we do a request to this endpoint we will get a random cat image. However, the developers have included a set of parameters that can delimit the search like the size of the image, the type of the image, the format of the response, if the image has a breed, etc. In that case, instead of just having a random cat image, we can retrieve a list of cat images with a size, media type, and with a specific limit. Then, the part of the endpoint will be like this:\nsearch?size=small&mime_types=gif&limit=10\nNote that the query parameters are separated from the path by a question mark (?) and they are separated by ampersands (&).

    "section": "Using an API",
    "text": "Using an API\nFor those unfamiliar with computer science, APIs can be a bit abstract, so let’s try to explain it better with this example using the The Cat API. This API allows you to get information about different cat and dog breeds, with images and descriptions. The information is not available through a public interface, so if you want to see a cat image, you must use the API.\nIn this example, let’s get the information about the Ragdoll cat breed. To do this, we require to use this API endpoint: https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/XFhRpYS_D.\nYou can click on that link to view the information about the cat in a format similar to this:\n\n\nCode\nasync function getCatData(catId) {\n    const url = `https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/${catId}`;\n    const response = await fetch(url);\n    if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);\n    const data = await response.json();\n    return data;\n}\n\ncatData = await getCatData(\"XFhRpYS_D\");\n\nJSON.stringify(catData, null, 2);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis format is called JSON, and its widely used in APIs to return data. We will see more about this format later, but for now, we can say that this output is called a response, and it contains keys and values. Keys are the names of the information we requested and values are the information we received. For instance, in this response, the url to the image of a Ragdoll cat can be found under the url key, and its value is https://cdn2.thecatapi.com/images/XFhRpYS_D.jpg.\n\n\n\nJSON syntax\n\n\nNow, what we want to do is to get the image of the Ragdoll, not just the abstract information. To do this, we have to access the values associated with each key. The url to the image is under the url key, the name of the cat is under the breeds key and the description is under the description key. With a bit of coding, we can display the image of the cat:\n\n\nCode\nfunction displayCat(data) {\n    const container = html`&lt;div class=\"card\" style=\"max-width: 300px; margin: 15px auto;\"&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"${data.url}\" class=\"card-img-top\" alt=\"Ragdoll cat\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"card-body\"&gt;\n            &lt;h5 class=\"card-title\"&gt;Breed: ${data.breeds[0].name}&lt;/h5&gt;\n            &lt;p class=\"card-text\"&gt;${data.breeds[0].description}&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;`;\n    return container;\n}\n\ndisplayCat(catData);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCute, isn’t it?\nWhat the API is doing, is to get the information from the server database, return it to the client in a format that can be easily parsed by a computer, and then the browser can use this information to display the cat image, or to get additional information about the cat.\n\n\n\nA simple representation of an API (click to zoom)\n\n\nWith that information, we can display the information in a more readable format, and reutilize the method to get the image of other cats, for instance, a Bengal cat:\n\n\nCode\nbengalCatData = await getCatData(\"LSaDk6OjY\");\ndisplayCat(bengalCatData);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can even get a random cat image!\n  Code \n\n\n\nClick here to get a random cat :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we’ve seen how APIs work, let’s dive into why they’re so essential.",

    "section": "Why Do We Need APIs?",
    "text": "Why Do We Need APIs?\nA common question might be: why use an API instead of simply sharing the data directly?\n\nSimplifying Access to Data\nFor researchers, APIs simplify access to complex datasets. Imagine working with a public archive or a library catalog where data is stored in various relational tables. Instead of manually extracting and organizing the data, an API allows you to query for specific subsets—like texts published in a particular year or metadata about historical photographs—without worrying about the database structure.\nAn API simplifies this process by predefining these complex queries and providing endpoints to access the data you need with minimal effort. Instead of interacting directly with the database, users make requests to the API and receive only the required data in a user-friendly format, like JSON.\n\n\nEnhancing Security and Performance\nDirect access to a database can compromise its security and integrity. Opening a database to the public exposes it to risks, such as unauthorized modifications or data breaches. APIs mitigate these risks by controlling what data is accessible and to whom. For instance APIs can restrict access to specific users or IP addresses. APIs can also limit the amount of data retrieved, improving performance.\nFor collaborative research, APIs ensure secure and consistent access to data across teams and institutions. They also enhance reproducibility by allowing other researchers to replicate data retrieval processes through well-documented endpoints.\n\n\nWhy Not Share Data as a Downloadable File?\nSharing data in formats like Excel or CSV files can sometimes be a practical solution. However, this approach has significant limitations, for instance, downloadable files do not automatically update when the source data changes. Users must re-download the file every time updates are made, which can lead to outdated information. Another limitation is associated with the size of the file. For large datasets, downloading and processing the entire file can be inefficient and cumbersome.\nUltimately, whether to use an API or share data as a downloadable file depends on the project’s specific needs, balancing dynamic access with ease of use. When you need to retrieve specific data subsets or interact with the data dynamically, an API is ideal. It provides granularity and ensures users access the most up-to-date information. When users need the entire dataset for analysis or offline use, offering a downloadable file might be more appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPIs for bulk data retrieval\n\n\n\n\n\nAPIs are not designed for bulk data retrieval but for accessing data in a more focused and controlled way. It bridges the gap between complex databases and the users who need specific, timely information.",

Now, let’s do an exercise to practice what we have learned.\nA query is basically a question, so, let’s try to answer this question: “How many ‘knights’ are in the department of Medieval Art of the Metropolitan Museum of Art?” To answer that question, we have to segment it into multiple parts:\n\nWhat is required to search within a specific department in the API?\nWhat endpoint do we need to use?\nWhat parameters do we need to use?\nWhat’s the previous information we need to retrieve before doing the query?\nWhat is the query we need to use?\nHow do we get the specific information we need?\n\nSeems like a lot of steps, but it’s not too complex as it might seem. Let’s start with the first step: looking at the API documentation: Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API\nBecause the first question is about searching within a specific scope, let’s start with the search endpoint. As we can see, there is a list of paremeters, the first one is q, which is the one that helps us to search by term (like ‘knight’); and scrolling down a little, we can see the departmentId parameter, which requires a numeric (integer) identifier corresponding to the department we want to search within:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nFormat\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nq\nSearch term e.g. sunflowers\nReturns a listing of all Object IDs for objects that contain the search query within the object’s data\n\n\ndepartmentId\nInteger\nReturns objects that are a part of a specific department. For a list of departments and department IDs, refer to our /department endpoint: https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/public/collection/v1/departments\n\n\n\nAs you can see, documentation is the best starting point to interact with an API. With that information, we have answered not only the first question, but also what endpoint, parameters, and previous information we need to retrieve before doing the query.\nBefore proceeding with the next question, let’s get the list of departments and their IDs to select the one corresponding to the ‘Medieval Art’ department. To do that, just paste the ‘/department’ endpoint as is pointed out in the documentation.\n\n\nCode\nviewof departmentListEndpoint = Inputs.text({\n    label: \"Department list\",\n    placeholder: \"\",\n    value: \"\",\n    attributes: {\n        class: \"form-control mb-3\"\n    }\n})\n\nasync function fetchDepartmentList(endpoint) {\n    try {\n        const response = await fetch(endpoint);\n        const status = {\n            code: response.status,\n            ok: response.ok,\n            text: response.statusText\n        };\n\n        if (!response.ok) {\n            throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);\n        }\n\n        const data = await response.json();\n        return { data, status};\n    } catch (error) {\n        return {\n            data: { \"Message\": `Error: ${error.message}` },\n            status: {\n                code: 400,\n                ok: false,\n                text: \"Bad Request\"\n            }\n        };\n    }\n}\n\ndepartmentList = {\n    if (departmentListEndpoint) {\n        const result = await fetchDepartmentList(departmentListEndpoint);\n        return result;\n    } else {\n        return {\n            data: { \"Message\": \"You need to enter a valid endpoint.\" },\n            status: {\n                code: 400,\n                ok: false,\n                text: \"Bad Request\"\n            }\n        };\n    }\n}\n\nprettyDepartmentList = {\n    if (typeof departmentList === 'string') {\n        return JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(departmentList), null, 2);\n    } else {\n        return JSON.stringify(departmentList, null, 2);\n    }\n}\n\nviewof prettyDepartmentListContainer = {\n    let content;\n    if (departmentList.data.Message) {\n        content = html`&lt;div class=\"alert alert-warning m-0\"&gt;${departmentList.data.Message}&lt;/div&gt;`;\n    } else {\n        content = html`&lt;pre class=\"card-body m-0\" style=\"background-color: #f8f9fa; max-height: 400px; overflow-y: auto;\"&gt;${prettyDepartmentList}&lt;/pre&gt;`;\n    }\n    \n    const badgeClass = departmentList.status.ok ? \"bg-success\" : \"bg-danger\";\n    \n    const container = html`&lt;div class=\"card\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"card-header d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center\"&gt;\n            &lt;span&gt;Department list&lt;/span&gt;\n            &lt;span class=\"badge ${badgeClass}\"&gt;${departmentList.status.code} ${departmentList.status.text}&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        ${content}\n    &lt;/div&gt;`;\n    return container;\n}",
