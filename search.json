    "text": "Request Methods\nA request method indicates the purpose of an HTTP request and the kind of response we expect. These methods act as semantic instructions for the server, which can respond with data, an error message, or a status update depending on whether the action is valid and allowed.\nThe most common HTTP methods are:\n\nGET\nAs we’ve already seen, the GET method is used to retrieve data from a server or resource. It doesn’t alter anything on the server, it just requests information.\nThe parameters included in the request URL help define the response. For example, a GET request can return a single item (e.g., images/{image_id}), or a list of items, as in the example we used at the beginning of this section.\n\n\n\nGET request\n\n\n\n\nPOST\nThe POST method is used to send data to a server. For example, when you fill out a form and click the “Submit” button, your browser typically sends a POST request containing that data. The server processes it—often creating a new resource or triggering an action.\nData for a POST request goes in the body (not the URL) and can be:\n\nform-data\n\nbinary (e.g., an image)\n\nraw text (e.g., JSON, XML)\n\nLater on, we’ll explore how to configure and send these request bodies using practical tools.\n\n\n\nPOST request\n\n\n\n\nPUT\nThe PUT method is used to update an existing resource. It looks similar to POST, but there’s an important difference: PUT requires the resource to already exist, and it typically replaces the entire object with the new data provided.\nIn other words, while POST is used to create something new, PUT is used to overwrite an existing record at a specific location (e.g., /images/{image_id}).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don’t include all fields in a PUT request, some servers may interpret that as a request to remove the missing fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPUT request\n\n\n\n\nPATCH\nThe PATCH method can be understood as a way to edit an existing record. Unlike PUT, which typically replaces the entire resource, PATCH allows you to update only specific fields.\nThe values to be updated are included in the body of the request and will only overwrite the specified elements, leaving the rest of the record unchanged.\nFor example, sending the following body to /images/{image_id}:\n{\n  \"pending\": 1,\n  \"approved\": 0\n}\nwill update only those two fields in the existing record.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn many cases, using PATCH is safer than PUT—especially when we want to avoid unintentionally removing fields that weren’t included in the update. For that reason, PATCH is more commonly supported than PUT in modern APIs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPATCH request\n\n\n\n\nDELETE\nThe DELETE method is fairly self-explanatory. It takes a specific record identifier and removes that resource from the server.\nTypically, the response is a success status code (such as 200 OK or 204 No Content) confirming that the item has been deleted.\nBecause of its potential impact, the use of this method is usually restricted to authenticated users and requires proper authorization or ownership. It’s rarely, if ever, available to anonymous users.\n\n\n\nDELETE request\n\n\n\n\nHTTP Request Methods at a Glance\nWe can visualize the main difference between these methods using the following table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nPurpose\nRequires Existing Resource?\nTypical Use Case\nData Sent In\nCommon Response\n\n\n\n\nGET\nRetrieve data\n❌ No\nFetching a list or a single item\nURL (query params)\n200 OK, JSON data\n\n\nPOST\nCreate a new resource\n❌ No\nSubmitting a form, creating an object\nBody\n201 Created\n\n\nPUT\nReplace an existing resource\n✅ Yes\nOverwriting an entire object\nBody\n200 OK or 204 No Content\n\n\nPATCH\nUpdate specific fields\n✅ Yes\nEditing part of an existing record\nBody\n200 OK or 204 No Content\n\n\nDELETE\nRemove a resource\n✅ Yes\nDeleting a specific item\nURL\n204 No Content",

    "text": "A query is basically a question, so, let’s try to answer this question: How many ‘knights’ are in the department of Medieval Art of the Metropolitan Museum of Art? To answer that question, we have to segment it into multiple parts:\n\nWhat is required to search within a specific department in the API?\nWhat endpoint do we need to use?\nWhat parameters do we need to use?\nWhat’s the previous information we need to retrieve before doing the query?\nWhat is the query we need to use?\nHow do we get the specific information we need?\n\nSeems like a lot of steps, but it’s not too complex as it might seem. Let’s start with the first step: looking at the API documentation: Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API\nBecause the first question is about searching within a specific scope, let’s start with the search endpoint. As we can see, there is a list of paremeters, the first one is q, which is the one that helps us to search by term (like ‘knight’); and scrolling down a little, we can see the departmentId parameter, which requires a numeric (integer) identifier corresponding to the department we want to search within:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nFormat\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nq\nSearch term e.g. sunflowers\nReturns a listing of all Object IDs for objects that contain the search query within the object’s data\n\n\ndepartmentId\nInteger\nReturns objects that are a part of a specific department. For a list of departments and department IDs, refer to our /department endpoint: https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/public/collection/v1/departments \n\n\n\nAs you can see, documentation is the best starting point to interact with an API. With that information, we have answered not only the first question, but also what endpoint, parameters, and previous information we need to retrieve before doing the query.\nBefore proceeding with the next question, let’s get the list of departments and their IDs to select the one corresponding to the ‘Medieval Art’ department. To do that, just paste the ‘/department’ endpoint as is pointed out in the documentation (if you get lost, follow the hints ;) ).\nScroll down to see the list of departments and their departmentId. Copy the value of the departmentId for the ‘Medieval Art’ department (the number, not the name). We’ve underlined the value in the list for you.\n\n\nCode\nviewof departmentListEndpoint = Inputs.text({\n  label: \"Department list\",\n  placeholder: \"\",\n  value: \"\",\n  attributes: {\n    class: \"form-control mb-3\"\n  }\n})\n\n/**\n * The purpose of this function is to validate the endpoint\n * for students.

Simply paste the full endpoint into your browser to see a response like this:\n\n{\n     \"total\": 7136,\n     \"objectIDs\": [\n        32830, 32831, 32832, 32833, 32834,\n        32835, 32836, 32837, 32838, 32839,\n        // ... many more IDs ...\n        818469, 818574, 831188\n        ]\n}\nOnce we have an object ID, we can use it to get detailed information about that object by appending the ID to the endpoint https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/public/collection/v1/objects/{objectID}. For example, the object with ID 32830 gives the following detailed response:\n{\n  \"objectID\": 32830,\n  \"isHighlight\": false,\n  \"accessionNumber\": \"23.21.2\",\n  \"accessionYear\": \"1923\",\n  \"isPublicDomain\": true,\n  \"primaryImage\": \"https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/md/original/DP164978.jpg\",\n  \"primaryImageSmall\": \"https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/md/web-large/DP164978.jpg\",\n  \"additionalImages\": [\n    \"https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/md/original/DP164979.jpg\"\n  ],\n  \"constituents\": null,\n  \"department\": \"Medieval Art\",\n  \"objectName\": \"Manuscript cutting from a Dominican antiphonary\",\n  \"title\": \"Initial P with the Martyrdom of Saint Peter Martyr\",\n  \"culture\": \"Italian\",\n  \"period\": \"\",\n  \"dynasty\": \"\",\n  \"reign\": \"\",\n  \"portfolio\": \"\",\n  \"artistRole\": \"\",\n  \"artistPrefix\": \"\",\n  \"artistDisplayName\": \"\",\n  \"artistDisplayBio\": \"\",\n  \"artistSuffix\": \"\",\n  \"artistAlphaSort\": \"\",\n  \"artistNationality\": \"\",\n  \"artistBeginDate\": \"\",\n  \"artistEndDate\": \"\",\n  \"artistGender\": \"\",\n  \"artistWikidata_URL\": \"\",\n  \"artistULAN_URL\": \"\",\n  \"objectDate\": \"second half 13th century\",\n  \"objectBeginDate\": 1350,\n  \"objectEndDate\": 1400,\n  \"medium\": \"Tempera and ink on parchment\",\n  \"dimensions\": \"3 1/8 x 2 13/16 in.

The tags field is particularly valuable because it uses controlled vocabularies like the Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT) and Wikidata, ensuring consistency across the dataset. These terms capture key themes and concepts, making them ideal for analyzing thematic areas in Medieval Art.\nDocumenting the focus of our analysis in a README.md file is a critical step in ensuring transparency and reproducibility. The README.md file provides future researchers (or your future self!) with a clear understanding of the dataset, its purpose, and how it was used. Here’s an example of how you can document this information:\nHaving identified the tags field as the focus of our analysis, we can include that information in our README.md file to document the project.

    "text": "Collecting data\nNow that we have identified the tags field as the focus of our analysis, we can start collecting data. To do this, we need to extract the specific information we need and store it in a format suitable for analysis.\nTypically, this involves isolating the necessary information and storing it in a structured format like CSV (Comma-Separated Values). For our purpose, the CSV file will have two columns: objectID and tags. An example of the data is shown below:\nobjectID,terms\n462990,\"['Entombment', 'Christ', 'Virgin Mary']\"\n462991,['Women']\n462992,\"['Men', 'Cross', 'Christ']\"\n462994,['Men']\n462995,['Men']\n462997,\"['Cross', 'Christ']\"\n462998,\"['Animals', 'Birds']\"\n463015,\"['Men', 'Portraits']\"\n463023,['Deer']\n463024,['Eagles']\n463032,\"['Entombment', 'Christ']\"\n463036,\"['Illness', 'Men', 'Women']\"\n463037,\"['Kings', 'Women', 'David', 'Eve']\"\n463039,\"['Kings', 'Baptismal Fonts', 'Saints']\"\n463040,\"['Infants', 'Women', 'Baptismal Fonts']\"\n463052,['Deer']\n463081,\"['Animals', 'Cross']\"\n463083,['Human Figures']\n463084,\"['Human Figures', 'Angels']\"\nThis data was collected from the first 100 objects in the Medieval Art collection. It’s important to note that not all objects have tags, and some only have one term. Exploring the data is crucial to understanding its completeness and whether it can answer our research question.\nInstead of treating tags as separate labels, we analyze co-occurrence—when two terms appear together in the same object. By counting these relationships, we can visualize which themes are closely related across different artworks. Even with incomplete data, we can identify thematic areas. For example, we can extract term pairs that co-occur within the same object. For object ID 462990, the terms Entombment, Christ, and Virgin Mary co-occur, which can be represented like this:\nSource,Target\nEntombment,Christ\nEntombment,Virgin Mary\nChrist,Virgin Mary\nWhen we notice that some pairs repeat across different objects, we can add weights to these pairs. For example, the pair Men and Cross appears in both 462992 and 462997, giving it a weight of 2. The table becomes:\nSource,Target,Weight\nEntombment,Christ,1\nEntombment,Virgin Mary,1\nChrist,Virgin Mary,1\nMen,Cross,2\nMen,Christ,1\nCross,Christ,1\nUsing this small sample, we can already start drafting a simple network graph to visualize these relationships.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(igraph)\n\nedges &lt;- data.frame(\n  Source = c(\n  \"Entombment\", \"Entombment\", \"Christ\", \"Men\", \"Men\", \"Cross\", \n  \"Animals\", \"Men\", \"Illness\", \"Illness\", \"Men\", \"Kings\", \n  \"Kings\", \"Kings\", \"Women\", \"Women\", \"David\"\n),\n  Target = c(\n  \"Christ\", \"Virgin Mary\", \"Virgin Mary\", \"Cross\", \"Christ\", \"Christ\", \n  \"Birds\", \"Portraits\", \"Men\", \"Women\", \"Women\", \"Women\", \n  \"David\", \"Eve\", \"David\", \"Eve\", \"Eve\"\n),\n  Weight = c(\n  2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1\n)\n\n)\n\nnetwork &lt;- graph_from_data_frame(edges, directed = FALSE)\n\nplot(\n  network,\n  vertex.size = 30,\n  vertex.label.cex = 0.8,\n  edge.width = E(network)$Weight * 2,\n  edge.color = \"gray50\",\n  vertex.color = \"lightblue\",\n  main = \"Network Graph\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis simple network graph provides a glimpse of the relationships between terms. For instance, we can see how the network is highly centered around the term “Men,” which connects with other groups associated with “Christ.” In contrast, “Women” is part of a smaller group tied to terms like “Eve,” “David,” and “Kings.” While this is just a small sample, it demonstrates how network analysis can reveal thematic patterns.\nWith this proof of concept, we’re ready to scale up to the entire Medieval Art collection. The complete data includes term pairs from 3695 objects, resulting in 1725 unique pairs. The dataset is stored in a CSV file, which can be accessed here: Medieval Art Data - Tags Pairs.

You can download the data directly from the repository to use it in your own analysis.\n\n\n\nIn the next chapter, we’ll use this full dataset to build a comprehensive network graph, analyze its structure, and uncover thematic clusters that provide deeper insights into the Medieval Art collection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipA Note About Automation\n\n\n\n\n\nManually collecting data from over 7,000+ objects would be time-consuming and error-prone. By automating the retrieval and processing of metadata, we ensure accuracy, reproducibility, and scalability—allowing us to apply this method to other museum collections in the future.\nTo collect the data for this project, we used a Python script to automate the process. The script performs the following steps:\n\nRetrieves object IDs from the API.\nFetches tags for each object.\nGenerates term pairs and calculates weights.\nSaves the results in a CSV file for analysis.\n\nCode is available in the project repository. If you’re familiar with Python, you can experiment with it to collect data from other departments or customize it to fit your needs",

    "text": "Postman is a widely used platform that facilitates interaction with APIs. Originally designed for testing APIs in development environments, it has become a powerful tool for exploring and managing API requests in both individual and collaborative workflows.\nOne of Postman’s major strengths is that it enables users without programming experience to interact with API services in a comprehensive and structured way. Users can send requests to read, write, update, and delete information from an API, all through a visual interface. This includes managing authentication credentials securely (even OAuth), defining public and secret variables, configuring headers, adding parameters, and submitting body content in various formats (form-data, binary, raw JSON, GraphQL, etc.).",

By keeping secrets and credentials on the desktop client, rather than the web interface, Postman ensures that each user interacts with an API using their own credentials, rather than sharing a common set of keys.\nThis approach enhances security and allows for granular control over user actions, enabling organizations to manage permissions more effectively and reduce the risk of unauthorized access.",

In the top-right corner of Postman, you’ll see a button labeled “No Environment”. Click it and select CatAPI from the dropdown menu:\n\nNow, go to the request URL field. Carefully remove https://api.thecatapi.com/v1 from the beginning — but be sure to leave the trailing slash in /breeds intact.\nType { in the field, and you’ll see a dropdown menu showing available variables from the CatAPI environment, along with global variables provided by Postman. If you hover over a variable name, Postman will display its value.\n\nSelect the url variable. Your request should now look like this:\n{{url}}/breeds\nTo confirm that everything is working correctly, click Send again.

    "text": "Using Secrets in a Request\nThe most common way to send authenticated requests is by including a token in the request headers. Let’s try that using our Search Cat Images request.\nFirst, replace the URL with your {{url}} default variable, just like we did in the previous exercise.\nNext, click on the Headers tab, located just below the URL field. You’ll see a table where you can add header keys, values, and optional descriptions. HTTP headers are metadata that provide additional context about the request and help the server prepare an appropriate response.\nTo learn how to include the API token, let’s refer to the Cat API documentation:\n\nTo get more than 10, and additional fields then be sure to use your API Key from the welcome email as the ‘x-api-key’ header, or ?api_key= query string parameter to access all the images and data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may have noticed that it’s also possible to send the API key as a query parameter in the URL. While this works, it’s not recommended. Even though Postman keeps the token secret in your environment, placing it in the URL exposes it in the browser or server logs when the request is made.\n\n\n\nTo add the header, use the following values:\n\nKey: x-api-key\n\nValue: {{api_token}}\n\nNow run the request again. You’ll see that the limit=3 parameter works as expected — and you can even increase it (e.g., to 30) without any issue. Because the request is now authenticated, the API allows access to features that aren’t available to unauthenticated users.",

That means we can upload images to our “own” collection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that The Cat API is primarily a testing platform. It’s not intended to store personal information long-term.\nUploading pictures of your cats is totally fine, just don’t use it as a personal photo album! 😉\n\n\n\nLet’s test this by creating a new GET request called “myImages”.\n\nAdd it to your CatAPI collection.\nMake sure the CatAPI environment is selected.\nIn the URL field, enter:\n\n{{url}}/images/\nIf you run this request, you might see an error message like this:\nAUTHENTICATION_ERROR - the header \"x-api-key\" is invalid, check it then try again\nThis happens because we haven’t included our api_token secret in the request headers. Once you add the header (x-api-key: {{api_token}}), run the request again — you should now get an empty array in the response.\nThat means your personal image collection is accessible — and ready for uploads!\n\n\n\nPOSTMAN images collection\n\n\n\nWriting the POST Request\nTo understand how to upload an image to The Cat API using a POST request, let’s refer to their documentation ↗️.\nOnce there, navigate to the Images section and locate:\nPOST /images/upload\nThis page provides useful information for constructing our request. Focus on the “Request Body Schema” section. It lists three parameters:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nfile\nstring &lt;binary&gt;\nThe binary file data of the image to be uploaded.\n\n\nsub_id\nstring (optional)\nA string used to segment your images (e.g., identify the user).\n\n\nbreeds_ids\nstring (optional)\nComma-separated list of breed IDs shown in the image.\n\n\n\nTo keep things simple, we’ll just use the required file parameter. As noted, it accepts a string of type binary, which refers to the actual image file you want to upload.\nLet’s walk through how to set up this POST request in Postman.\n\n\nIn your collection, create a new request and name it “Upload Cat Image”.\nChange the request type from GET to POST.\nEnsure the CatAPI environment is selected.\nIn the URL field, enter:\n\n{{url}}/images/upload\n\nAdd the API key\n\nGo to the Headers tab and add the following:\n\n\nKey: x-api-key\nValue: {{api_token}}\n\n\n\nConfigure the request body\n\nClick the Body tab. You’ll see several content type options:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nnone\nNo data will be sent with the request.\n\n\nform-data\nSimulates form submissions (key, data type, and value).\n\n\nx-www-form-urlencoded\nSends key-value pairs in URL-encoded format (similar to form-data).\n\n\nraw\nUsed to send raw text (typically JSON or XML).\n\n\nbinary\nUsed to send files like images, video, or audio.\n\n\nGraphQL\nFor structured GraphQL queries to compatible APIs.\n\n\n\nWe’ll use form-data for this request — even though the image is binary — as indicated in The Cat API documentation.\n\n\n\nSending Binary Content\nPostman makes it easy to upload files as part of a request. When using the desktop application, you can simply select the image file from your computer, and Postman will attach it as binary content in the body of the request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember that this is a public testing API. If you’re uploading a picture of your cat, make sure not to include any people, addresses, or personal information in the image or filename.\n\n\n\nNow, this part can be a little confusing: although the file itself is binary, we still need to use the form-data option — not the binary option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteWhy use form-data instead of binary?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reason is that the API expects the image to be sent as part of a multipart/form-data request — just like a file upload in a browser form. The binary mode in Postman sends only the file content, without a field name or other metadata. But the Cat API expects a form-like structure with the field named file.\nIn simple terms: if we send the data as binary, the server won’t know what to do with it.\n\n\n\nLet’s attach our image by selecting form-data from the Body menu. Then, add the following:\n\nKey: file\n\nFrom the dropdown menu next to the key, select File instead of Text.\n\nValue: Click + Select File and choose a file from your local machine.\n\nYou should see something like this:\n\n\n\nPOSTMAN Body file-form attached file\n\n\nNow you can send the request. If it’s successful, you’ll see a response like this:\n\n\n\nPOSTMAN POST request success message\n\n\nThe warning icon before the filename and the cloud upload symbol are optional indicators — useful if you’re working in a shared workspace and want to sync files with your team.\nOnce uploaded, you can access the image directly from The Cat API using the ID it returns — in this case, 8ML9aFY8p.\n\n\nCode\nasync function getCatData(catId) {\n  const url = `https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/${catId}`;\n  const response = await fetch(url);\n  if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);\n  const data = await response.json();\n  return data;\n}\n\ncatData = await getCatData(\"8ML9aFY8p\")\n\nviewof catDataString = {\n  const pre = html`&lt;pre style=\"background-color: #f8f9fa; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; overflow-x: auto;\"&gt;`;\n  const code = html`&lt;code style=\"color: #333;\"&gt;`;\n  \n  // Formatted JSON with syntax highlighting\n  const formatted = JSON.stringify(catData, null, 2)\n  .replace(/&/g, '&amp;')\n  .replace(/&lt;/g, '&lt;')\n  .replace(/&gt;/g, '&gt;')\n  .replace(/\"([^\"]+)\":/g, '&lt;span style=\"color: #a31515;\"&gt;\"$1\"&lt;/span&gt;:') \n  .replace(/: \"([^\"]+)\"/g, ': &lt;span style=\"color: #008000;\"&gt;\"$1\"&lt;/span&gt;')  \n  .replace(/: ([0-9]+)/g, ': &lt;span style=\"color: #0000FF;\"&gt;$1&lt;/span&gt;')  \n  .replace(/\\b(true|false|null)\\b/g, '&lt;span style=\"color: #FF0000;\"&gt;$1&lt;/span&gt;');\n  \n  code.innerHTML = formatted;\n  pre.appendChild(code);\n  return pre;\n}\n\nfunction displayCat(data) {\n  const container = html`&lt;div class=\"card\" style=\"max-width: 300px; margin: 15px auto;\"&gt;\n    &lt;img src=\"${data.url}\" class=\"card-img-top\" alt=\"Silvestre\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"card-body\"&gt;\n    &lt;h5 class=\"card-title\"&gt;Let me introduce you to Silvestre :)&lt;/h5&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;`;\n  return container;\n}\n\ndisplayCat(catData);",

A graph layout allows us to represent nodes (tags) and edges (relationships) in a structured way, making it easier to explore clusters, central terms, and thematic areas.\nThere are multiple tools available for network visualization, ranging from desktop applications to web-based platforms:\n\nGephi (desktop | Gephi Lite) – A powerful open-source tool for network analysis.\nCytoscape (desktop) – Commonly used in bioinformatics and large-scale networks.\nRetina (web-based) – A browser-friendly tool that allows interactive exploration.\n\nFor this workshop, we will explore the network using Retina, which enables interactive exploration directly in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteRetina as a Web API for Network Visualization\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike traditional network visualization tools, Retina works dynamically through URL parameters, making it function similarly to a Web API. Instead of manually adjusting settings in a graphical interface, Retina allows users to modify the view using URL parameters. These parameters control layout, node size, color attributes, filtering, and focus points—all without needing a separate backend. Because the graph is rendered directly in the user’s browser, all changes happen client-side, just like API calls retrieving data.\nThis means we can construct Retina URLs dynamically to generate custom views of our network, making it a powerful tool for API-driven scientific research.\nBy tweaking the URL, you can reconfigure the network visualization dynamically, much like calling an API with different query parameters!\n\n\n\nThe layout for this visualization was prepared in Gephi and then exported to Retina, but you can also import the raw GEXF file into Retina and generate a similar graph from scratch.\n\n\nYou can also explore the network in a new tab by clicking here\nThe network is fully interactive, allowing you to zoom in and out to examine specific areas or use the search bar to locate a particular term. Each node represents a tag from the dataset, and its color and size reflect important network properties.\n\nColor is determined by the modularity class, which groups related terms into thematic communities. Terms that frequently appear together in the dataset will tend to cluster, forming distinct regions in the network.\nSize is based on Eigenvector Centrality, a measure of influence within the network. Larger nodes indicate terms that serve as key connectors, linking multiple themes together. For instance, if a term like “Christ” or “Virgin Mary” appears prominently, it suggests that it plays a central role in shaping the overall structure of the dataset.\n\nTo further customize your view, open the menu on the left and experiment with color and size settings to highlight different attributes. By adjusting these parameters, you can gain new insights into how terms interact and uncover unexpected thematic relationships within the Medieval Art collection.",

    "text": "Exploring the network\nOne of the challenges of using networks as a data visualization tool is the risk of creating a “hairball” — a dense, cluttered graph with too many connections, making it difficult to interpret patterns or insights. To address this issue, Retina offers built-in features that allow us to explore the network in more detail and isolate key themes.\n\nIsolate communities\nSince each community in our network represents a thematic area, we can filter specific communities to explore the terms they contain and their connections to the broader network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipHow to Isolate a Community in Retina\n\n\n\n\n\nA straightforward way to isolate communities is by using Retina’s “Explore” feature:\n\nOpen the Explore menu.\nClick on a community to highlight it.\nUse the filter options to hide other nodes and focus on a single thematic area.\n\n\n\n\nRetina Filter by Community\n\n\n\n\n\nOur analysis reveals 11 distinct communities, with three major groups containing most of the terms. Some communities are very small, consisting of just two or three nodes.\nTo explore this further, let’s isolate the largest community (Community 0) and analyze its structure in more detail:\n\n\nWith this filter applied, we can better interpret the network. Community 0 appears to represent “Animals, Plants, and Objects”, a broad category that connects mythical, religious, and historical figures with specific objects such as flowers, horses, and medallions.\n\n\nSpotlight on “Horses”\nTo further explore connections within Community 0, let’s isolate the term “Horses” using the search bar in Retina.\nThis reveals that “Horses” acts as a bridge between multiple thematic areas. It links to mythical and historical figures like Achilles, Alexander the Great, Andromache, Hercules, and Saint George. Additionally, it connects with other communities, including Community 4 (centered on “Men” and “Women”) and Community 3 (focused on “Christ” and “Virgin Mary”), highlighting its broad thematic relevance.\n\n\nBeyond connections, we can examine network metrics in the explore menu to better understand the role of “Horses” in the dataset. Below is a breakdown of key values and their meaning in the network:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetric\nValue (Horses)\nMeaning in Context\n\n\n\n\nEccentricity\n3\n“Horses” is relatively central, as its longest shortest path to another node is just 3 steps\n\n\nCloseness Centrality\n0.56\nA higher closeness value means “Horses” is well positioned, with short paths to many other nodes.\n\n\nHarmonic Closeness Centrality\n0.622\nAccounts for disconnected components, reinforcing the influence of “Horses” in the network.\n\n\nBetweenness Centrality\n0.041\nLow betweenness suggests that while “Horses” connects communities, it is not a major bridge.\n\n\nWeighted Degree\n174\n“Horses” has an exceptionally high number of connections, making it a key thematic term.\n\n\nModularity Class\n0\nIt belongs to the largest thematic cluster in the network.\n\n\nStat Inf Class\n14\nBased on Statistical Inference, this classification suggests “Horses” belongs to a statistically significant thematic grouping.\n\n\nClustering Coefficient\n0.167\nA low coefficient indicates “Horses” is not densely interconnected but still plays a linking role.\n\n\nTriangles\n381\nThe node appears in many tightly interconnected groups, suggesting strong thematic associations.\n\n\nEigenvector Centrality\n0.584\nHigh influence, indicating strong connections to other important terms.\n\n\n\nThis approach can be applied to any term in the network—by isolating a node and interpreting its metrics and connections, we can uncover hidden patterns and thematic relationships within the collection.",

    "text": "Some preliminary insights\nAfter this brief exploration, we can draw several preliminary conclusions about the structure of thematic areas in the Medieval Art collection. These insights not only help us understand how objects are categorized but also highlight broader patterns in cultural and religious representation.\n\n1. Thematic Areas Are Well-Defined but Overlapping\nThe network is clustered into 11 distinct communities, each representing a thematic area. From those, we can identify three major groups:\n\nCommunity 0 (Animals, Plants, and Objects) is a broad category that links religious, mythical, and historical figures to specific objects like horses, flowers, and medallions.\nCommunity 4 (Men & Women) represents human figures and social roles, and overlaps with religious themes.\nCommunity 3 (Christ & Virgin Mary) is highly centered on religious iconography.\n\nOther communities are highly specialized and relatively isolated from the rest of the network. Community 6, for example, is composed of just three nodes—Greek, Coptic, Documents—suggesting a connection to textual traditions rather than visual themes. Similarly, Community 8 consists only of Hands and Feet, likely indicating specific iconographic elements, while Community 9 pairs Dolphins with Female Nudes, pointing to a connection between aquatic imagery and representations of the human body.\n\n\n2. Certain Terms Act as “Bridges” Between Communities\nWhile the network is divided into distinct thematic areas, some terms serve as key connectors, linking multiple communities and acting as conceptual bridges.\nOne clear example is “Horses”, which appears in different contexts—connecting historical figures such as Alexander the Great, Achilles, and Saint George, while also maintaining links to broader thematic groups like Men and Women and Religious Figures. Similarly, Christ and Virgin Mary are central nodes within religious iconography, reinforcing strong intra-community ties. On the other hand, Men and Women function as structural connectors, bridging religious, mythological, and historical figures, reinforcing their role as central elements in medieval art representation.\n\n\n3. The Network Reveals How Art Metadata Is Structured\nThis exploration is not just about historical themes—it also shows how the Met Museum categorizes its objects. The fact that certain terms cluster together may reflect institutional categorization practices, rather than just organic historical connections.\n\n\n4. Unexpected Connections & The Importance of Structure\nHighly connected nodes such as “Men,” “Women,” and “Christ” dominate the network, but less connected nodes can still reveal meaningful insights. A prime example is “Noah”, a relatively isolated node that still exhibits a high clustering coefficient (0.857), indicating that it forms tight local connections despite its limited reach within the broader network.\n\n\nExamining Noah’s connections reveals both expected and surprising relationships. Unsurprisingly, Noah is linked to Moses, another Old Testament figure. However, an unexpected connection emerges between Noah and several Christian themes, including Coronation of the Virgin, Madonna and Child, and Virgin Mary.\nThis suggests that, within this dataset, Noah is not solely categorized within Old Testament narratives but also appears in contexts related to Marian iconography. This is surprising because Noah is typically associated with Genesis and the Flood rather than Christian representations of Mary. Why does he appear in relation to the Coronation of the Virgin? Could this be due to specific artistic traditions, metadata decisions, or broader iconographic patterns? This observation serves as a potential starting point for further research, demonstrating how network analysis can highlight overlooked connections and generate new research questions.",

    "text": "Wrapping Up\nThis exploration of the network has revealed key thematic clusters, influential terms, and even unexpected connections within the Medieval Art collection. By structuring metadata as a network, we uncovered both historical patterns and institutional categorization practices, highlighting the interplay between data and interpretation.\nWhile this approach provides a powerful way to visualize and analyze relationships at scale, it also raises important questions: Do these clusters reflect historical realities, or are they shaped by modern cataloging decisions? How might additional data—such as object provenance, artistic schools, or iconographic traditions—further refine our understanding?\nAs we wrap up, we’ll take a step back to reflect on what we’ve learned and consider the broader implications of using APIs and network analysis for cultural heritage research.",

    "section": "Using an API",
    "text": "Using an API\nFor those unfamiliar with computer science, APIs can be a bit abstract, so let’s try to explain it better with this example using the The Cat API. This API allows you to get information about different cat and dog breeds, with images and descriptions. The information is not available through a public interface, so if you want to see a cat image, you must use the API.\nIn this example, let’s get the information about the Ragdoll cat breed. To do this, we require to use this API endpoint: https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/XFhRpYS_D.\nYou can click on that link to view the information about the cat in a format similar to this:\n\n\nCode\nasync function getCatData(catId) {\n    const url = `https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/${catId}`;\n    const response = await fetch(url);\n    if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);\n    const data = await response.json();\n    return data;\n}\n\ncatData = await getCatData(\"XFhRpYS_D\");\n\nviewof catDataString = {\n  const pre = html`&lt;pre style=\"background-color: #f8f9fa; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; overflow-x: auto;\"&gt;`;\n  const code = html`&lt;code style=\"color: #333;\"&gt;`;\n  \n  // Formatted JSON with syntax highlighting\n  const formatted = JSON.stringify(catData, null, 2)\n    .replace(/&/g, '&amp;')\n    .replace(/&lt;/g, '&lt;')\n    .replace(/&gt;/g, '&gt;')\n    .replace(/\"([^\"]+)\":/g, '&lt;span style=\"color: #a31515;\"&gt;\"$1\"&lt;/span&gt;:') \n    .replace(/: \"([^\"]+)\"/g, ': &lt;span style=\"color: #008000;\"&gt;\"$1\"&lt;/span&gt;')  \n    .replace(/: ([0-9]+)/g, ': &lt;span style=\"color: #0000FF;\"&gt;$1&lt;/span&gt;')  \n    .replace(/\\b(true|false|null)\\b/g, '&lt;span style=\"color: #FF0000;\"&gt;$1&lt;/span&gt;');\n    \n  code.innerHTML = formatted;\n  pre.appendChild(code);\n  return pre;\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis format is called JSON, and its widely used in APIs to return data. We will see more about this format later, but for now, we can say that this output is called a response, and it contains keys and values. Keys are the names of the information we requested and values are the information we received. For instance, in this response, the url to the image of a Ragdoll cat can be found under the url key, and its value is https://cdn2.thecatapi.com/images/XFhRpYS_D.jpg.\n\n\n\nJSON syntax\n\n\nNow, what we want to do is to get the image of the Ragdoll, not just the abstract information. To do this, we have to access the values associated with each key. The url to the image is under the url key, the name of the cat is under the breeds key and the description is under the description key. With a bit of coding, we can display the image of the cat:\n\n\nCode\nfunction displayCat(data) {\n    const container = html`&lt;div class=\"card\" style=\"max-width: 300px; margin: 15px auto;\"&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"${data.url}\" class=\"card-img-top\" alt=\"Ragdoll cat\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"card-body\"&gt;\n            &lt;h5 class=\"card-title\"&gt;Breed: ${data.breeds[0].name}&lt;/h5&gt;\n            &lt;p class=\"card-text\"&gt;${data.breeds[0].description}&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;`;\n    return container;\n}\n\ndisplayCat(catData);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCute, isn’t it?\nWhat the API is doing, is to get the information from the server database, return it to the client in a format that can be easily parsed by a computer, and then the browser can use this information to display the cat image, or to get additional information about the cat.\n\n\n\nA simple representation of an API (click to zoom)\n\n\nWith that information, we can display the information in a more readable format, and reutilize the method to get the image of other cats, for instance, a Bengal cat:\n\n\nCode\nbengalCatData = await getCatData(\"LSaDk6OjY\");\ndisplayCat(bengalCatData);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can even get a random cat image!\n  Code \n\n\n\nClick here to get a random cat :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we’ve seen how APIs work, let’s dive into why they’re so essential.",

    "section": "Why Do We Need APIs?",
    "text": "Why Do We Need APIs?\nA common question might be: why use an API instead of simply sharing the data directly?\n\nSimplifying Access to Data\nFor researchers, APIs simplify access to complex datasets. Imagine working with a public archive or a library catalog where data is stored in various relational tables. Instead of manually extracting and organizing the data, an API allows you to query for specific subsets—like texts published in a particular year or metadata about historical photographs—without worrying about the database structure.\nAn API simplifies this process by predefining these complex queries and providing endpoints to access the data you need with minimal effort. Instead of interacting directly with the database, users make requests to the API and receive only the required data in a user-friendly format, like JSON.\n\n\nEnhancing Security and Performance\nDirect access to a database can compromise its security and integrity. Opening a database to the public exposes it to risks, such as unauthorized modifications or data breaches. APIs mitigate these risks by controlling what data is accessible and to whom. For instance APIs can restrict access to specific users or IP addresses. APIs can also limit the amount of data retrieved, improving performance.\nFor collaborative research, APIs ensure secure and consistent access to data across teams and institutions. They also enhance reproducibility by allowing other researchers to replicate data retrieval processes through well-documented endpoints.\n\n\nWhy Not Share Data as a Downloadable File?\nSharing data in formats like Excel or CSV files can sometimes be a practical solution. However, this approach has significant limitations, for instance, downloadable files do not automatically update when the source data changes. Users must re-download the file every time updates are made, which can lead to outdated information. Another limitation is associated with the size of the file. For large datasets, downloading and processing the entire file can be inefficient and cumbersome.\nUltimately, whether to use an API or share data as a downloadable file depends on the project’s specific needs, balancing dynamic access with ease of use. When you need to retrieve specific data subsets or interact with the data dynamically, an API is ideal. It provides granularity and ensures users access the most up-to-date information. When users need the entire dataset for analysis or offline use, offering a downloadable file might be more appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionAPIs for bulk data retrieval\n\n\n\n\n\nAPIs are not designed for bulk data retrieval but for accessing data in a more focused and controlled way. It bridges the gap between complex databases and the users who need specific, timely information.",

A historian studying digitized newspapers, for instance, can use APIs to query articles that mention specific events, dates, or people. Social scientists can analyze real-time conversations and trends through APIs from platforms like X or YouTube, while environmental researchers can leverage satellite data APIs to monitor deforestation patterns. By enabling seamless integration across datasets, APIs foster interdisciplinary collaboration and empower scholars to tackle complex questions with innovative approaches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteIn summary\n\n\n\n\n\nAPIs are not just tools for developers—they hold immense potential for researchers, too. By providing structured, dynamic access to datasets, APIs enable scholars to automate data collection, access real-time information, and integrate diverse data sources into their workflows. Whether you’re studying digital humanities, analyzing climate data, or investigating social media trends, APIs allow you to retrieve exactly the data you need, at scale and with precision. Embracing APIs as part of your research toolkit opens doors to innovative methodologies and insights that might otherwise remain out of reach.",

Let’s explore this with more detail.\nThe Cat API has an endpoint to search for cat images. The path of this endpoint is /v1/images/search. If we do a request to this endpoint we will get a random cat image. However, the developers have included a set of parameters that can delimit the search like the size of the image, the type of the image, the format of the response, if the image has a breed, etc. In that case, instead of just having a random cat image, we can retrieve a list of cat images with a size, media type, and with a specific limit. Then, the part of the endpoint will be like this:\nsearch?size=small&mime_types=gif&limit=10\nNote that the query parameters are separated from the path by a question mark (?) and they are separated by ampersands (&).
