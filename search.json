    "section": "",
    "text": "An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols enabling software programs to communicate and share information. While the term is often associated with “web APIs,” it encompasses a broader concept. For instance, an API might allow a library to share its collection data with a museum or enable a weather service to provide updates to a news organization. APIs operate based on predefined rules set by developers, specifying how data can be accessed and used. While some APIs are public, most are internal, facilitating communication between systems within an organization.\nFor those unfamiliar with computer science, APIs can be a bit abstract, so let’s try to explain it better with this example using the The Cat API. This API allows you to get information about different cat and dog breeds, with images and descriptions. The information is not available through a public interface, so if you want to see a cat image, you must use the API.\nIn this example, let’s get the information about the Ragdoll cat breed. To do this, we require to use this API endpoint: https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/XFhRpYS_D.\nYou can click on that link to view the information about the cat in a format similar to this:\n\n\n{\n    \"id\": \"XFhRpYS_D\",\n    \"url\": \"https://cdn2.thecatapi.com/images/XFhRpYS_D.jpg\",\n    \"breeds\": [\n        {\n            \"weight\": {\n                \"imperial\": \"12 - 20\",\n                \"metric\": \"5 - 9\"\n            },\n            \"id\": \"ragd\",\n            \"name\": \"Ragdoll\",\n            \"cfa_url\": \"http://cfa.org/Breeds/BreedsKthruR/Ragdoll.aspx\",\n            \"vetstreet_url\": \"http://www.vetstreet.com/cats/ragdoll\",\n            \"vcahospitals_url\": \"https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/cat-breeds/ragdoll\",\n            \"temperament\": \"Affectionate, Friendly, Gentle, Quiet, Easygoing\",\n            \"origin\": \"United States\",\n            \"country_codes\": \"US\",\n            \"country_code\": \"US\",\n            \"description\": \"Ragdolls love their people, greeting them at the door, following them around the house, and leaping into a lap or snuggling in bed whenever given the chance. They are the epitome of a lap cat, enjoy being carried and collapsing into the arms of anyone who holds them.\",\n            \"life_span\": \"12 - 17\",\n            \"indoor\": 0,\n            \"lap\": 1,\n            \"alt_names\": \"Rag doll\",\n            \"adaptability\": 5,\n            \"affection_level\": 5,\n            \"child_friendly\": 4,\n            \"dog_friendly\": 5,\n            \"energy_level\": 3,\n            \"grooming\": 2,\n            \"health_issues\": 3,\n            \"intelligence\": 3,\n            \"shedding_level\": 3,\n            \"social_needs\": 5,\n            \"stranger_friendly\": 3,\n            \"vocalisation\": 1,\n            \"experimental\": 0,\n            \"hairless\": 0,\n            \"natural\": 0,\n            \"rare\": 0,\n            \"rex\": 0,\n            \"suppressed_tail\": 0,\n            \"short_legs\": 0,\n            \"wikipedia_url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragdoll\",\n            \"hypoallergenic\": 0,\n            \"reference_image_id\": \"oGefY4YoG\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"width\": 800,\n    \"height\": 1229\n}\n\n\nThis format is called JSON, and its widely used in APIs to return data. We will see more about this format later, but for now, we can say that this output is called a response, and it contains keys and values. Keys are the names of the information we requested and values are the information we received. For instance, in this response, the url to the image of a Ragdoll cat can be found under the url key, and its value is https://cdn2.thecatapi.com/images/XFhRpYS_D.jpg.\n\n\n\nJSON syntax\n\n\nNow, what we want to do is to get the image of the Ragdoll, not just the abstract information. To do this, we have to access the values associated with each key. The url to the image is under the url key, the name of the cat is under the breeds key and the description is under the description key. With a bit of coding, we can display the image of the cat:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCute, isn’t it?\nWhat the API is doing, is to get the information from the server database, return it to the client in a format that can be easily parsed by a computer, and then the browser can use this information to display the cat image, or to get additional information about the cat.\n\n\n\nA simple representation of an API (click to zoom)\n\n\nWith that information, we can display the information in a more readable format, and reutilize the method to get the image of other cats, for instance, a Bengal cat:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can even get a random cat image!\n\n\n\nClick here to get a random cat :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn summary\n\n\n\n\n\nAPIs provide access to structured data from a database without requiring knowledge of its underlying structure, and allow us to reformat the information, must be as a user friendly representation, or even translate that information to a tabular format.",

For that reason, we could say that an endpoint is a specific type of URL that allows you to perform a specific action on a resource.\nThen, let’s break the pieces of an endpoint into three parts:",

The path can also specify the version of the API that is being used, for instance, “v1” or “v2”.\nIn the cat API, the path can be something like /v1/breeds.\nSome endpoints can include a resource identifier to retrieve a specific resource, for instance, the path /v1/breeds/ gives as response a list of all cat breeds, and it’s possible to retrieve a specific breed, let’s say “Korat”, by adding the identifier /kora to the path, so the full path would be /v1/breeds/kora.",

The query parameters are the part of endpoints that allows us to explore the data available in the API. This can include multiple parts used to specify the search. Let’s explore this with more detail.\nThe Cat API has an endpoint to search for cat images. The path of this endpoint is /v1/images/search. If we do a GET request to this endpoint we will get a random cat image. However, the developers have included a set of parameters that can delimit the search like the size of the image, the type of the image, the format of the response, if the image has a breed, etc. In that case, instead of just having a random cat image, we can retrieve a list of cat images with a size, media type, and with a specific limit. Then, the part of the endpoint will be like this:\nsearch?size=small&mime_types=gif&limit=10\nNote that the query parameters are separated from the path by a question mark (?) and they are separated by ampersands (&). Order of the parameters is not important, but using the correct name of the parameter is crucial.",

    "text": "A common question might be: why use an API instead of simply sharing the data directly?\n\n\nImagine we have a publicly available database. Typically, the data in such a database is divided into multiple tables—for example, one table for cat breeds, another for cat images, and so on. To search for all cat breeds, you would need to join several tables and perform a complex query, which can be challenging, especially for non-technical users.\nAn API simplifies this process by predefining these complex queries and providing endpoints to access the data you need with minimal effort. Instead of interacting directly with the database, users make requests to the API and receive only the required data in a user-friendly format, like JSON.\n\n\n\nDirect access to a database can compromise its security and integrity. Opening a database to the public exposes it to risks, such as unauthorized modifications or data breaches. APIs mitigate these risks by controlling what data is accessible and to whom. For instance APIs can restrict access to specific users or IP addresses. APIs can also limit the amount of data retrieved, improving performance.\n\n\n\nSharing data in formats like Excel or CSV files can sometimes be a practical solution. However, this approach has significant limitations, for instance, downloadable files do not automatically update when the source data changes. Users must re-download the file every time updates are made, which can lead to outdated information. Another limitation is associated with the size of the file. For large datasets, downloading and processing the entire file can be inefficient and cumbersome.\nThe decision to use an API or provide downloadable data depends on the project’s goals. When you need to retrieve specific data subsets or interact with the data dynamically, an API is ideal. It provides granularity and ensures users access the most up-to-date information. When users need the entire dataset for analysis or offline use, offering a downloadable file might be more appropriate.\nAn API is not designed for bulk data retrieval but for accessing data in a more focused and controlled way.
