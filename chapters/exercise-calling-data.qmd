A query is basically a question, so, let's try to answer this question: **How many 'knights' are in the department of Medieval Art of the Metropolitan Museum of Art?** To answer that question, we have to segment it into multiple parts:

1. What is required to search within a specific department in the API?
2. What endpoint do we need to use?
3. What parameters do we need to use?
4. What's the previous information we need to retrieve before doing the query?
5. What is the query we need to use?
6. How do we get the specific information we need?

Seems like a lot of steps, but it's not too complex as it might seem. Let's start with the first step: looking at the API documentation: [Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API](https://metmuseum.github.io/)

Because the first question is about searching within a specific scope, let's start with the [search endpoint](https://metmuseum.github.io/#search). As we can see, there is a list of paremeters, the first one is `q`, which is the one that helps us to search by term (like 'knight'); and scrolling down a little, we can see the `departmentId` parameter, which requires a numeric (*integer*) identifier corresponding to the department we want to search within:

| Parameter | Format | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `q` | Search term e.g. sunflowers | Returns a listing of all Object IDs for objects that contain the search query within the objectâ€™s data |
| `departmentId` | Integer | Returns objects that are a part of a specific department. For a list of departments and department IDs, refer to our /department endpoint: https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/public/collection/v1/departments | 

As you can see, documentation is the best starting point to interact with an API. With that information, we have answered not only the first question, but also what endpoint, parameters, and previous information we need to retrieve before doing the query.

Before proceeding with the next question, let's get the list of departments and their IDs to select the one corresponding to the 'Medieval Art' department. To do that, just paste the '/department' endpoint as is pointed out in the documentation.

```{ojs}

viewof departmentListEndpoint = Inputs.text({
    label: "Department list",
    placeholder: "",
    value: "",
    attributes: {
        class: "form-control mb-3"
    }
})

async function fetchDepartmentList(endpoint) {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(endpoint);
        const status = {
            code: response.status,
            ok: response.ok,
            text: response.statusText
        };

        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
        }

        const data = await response.json();
        return { data, status};
    } catch (error) {
        return {
            data: { "Message": `Error: ${error.message}` },
            status: {
                code: 400,
                ok: false,
                text: "Bad Request"
            }
        };
    }
}

departmentList = {
    if (departmentListEndpoint) {
        const result = await fetchDepartmentList(departmentListEndpoint);
        return result;
    } else {
        return {
            data: { "Message": "You need to enter a valid endpoint." },
            status: {
                code: 400,
                ok: false,
                text: "Bad Request"
            }
        };
    }
}

prettyDepartmentList = {
    if (typeof departmentList === 'string') {
        return JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(departmentList), null, 2);
    } else {
        return JSON.stringify(departmentList, null, 2);
    }
}

viewof prettyDepartmentListContainer = {
    let content;
    if (departmentList.data.Message) {
        content = html`<div class="alert alert-warning m-0">${departmentList.data.Message}</div>`;
    } else {
        content = html`<pre class="card-body m-0" style="background-color: #f8f9fa; max-height: 400px; overflow-y: auto;">${prettyDepartmentList}</pre>`;
    }
    
    const badgeClass = departmentList.status.ok ? "bg-success" : "bg-danger";
    
    const container = html`<div class="card">
        <div class="card-header d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center">
            <span>Department list</span>
            <span class="badge ${badgeClass}">${departmentList.status.code} ${departmentList.status.text}</span>
        </div>
        ${content}
    </div>`;
    return container;
}
```
