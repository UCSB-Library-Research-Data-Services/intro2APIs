You can run the Python parts of this workshop either in your browser (recommended) or on your own computer. This page helps you get set up so you can focus on the API concepts, not the tooling.

## No coding experience required
You can follow along even if you’re new to coding. Some setup steps may feel unfamiliar at first—that’s normal.

Also, don’t forget your **library resources**! Library catalogs often include excellent beginner-friendly programming books (print and online).

## How to Run Python Code
There are many ways to run Python. For this workshop, we recommend a browser-based option like [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/){target="_blank"} or [Binder](https://mybinder.org/){target="_blank"}. No installation required, and it’s easy to share work during a live session.

If you prefer to work locally, you can use an IDE such as [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/){target="_blank"}, [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/){target="_blank"}, or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){target="_blank"}.
:::

This workshop uses a **starter notebook** that’s already filled in with the code you’ll need. That way you can run cells immediately, follow along in a live workshop, and edit small parts without having to type everything from scratch.

## Libraries Used in This Workshop

Libraries are pre-built code packages that provide specific functionalities. In our case, we're going to require a library that help us to make HTTP requests, one that keeps our API key secure, and one that helps us extract keywords from text. The first cells in our notebook will be dedicated to installing and importing these libraries.

### Installing Libraries
```{python}
#| output: false
%pip install yake # Keyword extraction library
%pip install tqdm # Progress bar library
%pip install httpx # HTTP client library
```

### Importing Libraries
```{python}
# Import built-in libraries
import os # For environment variable management
import time # For adding delays between API requests
import json # For working with JSON data
from getpass import getpass # For securely inputting API keys

# Import third-party libraries
import httpx # For making HTTP requests
from urllib.parse import urlsplit, parse_qsl, urlencode, urlunsplit # For URL manipulation
import yake # For keyword extraction
from tqdm import tqdm # For displaying progress bars
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # For data visualization
```

```{python}
#| output: false
#| echo: false

api_key = os.getenv("DPLA_API_KEY")
if not api_key:
    api_key = ""

```

## Constants

Technically speaking, a constant is a value that cannot be changed once it's set. Python doesn't have a built-in mechanism to strictly enfonce this immutability, but relies on a strong community-adopted [naming convention](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#constants){target="_blank"}.

The "Pythonic" way to define a constant is to use all uppercase letters with underscores separating words. This signals to other developers that the variable's value should not be modified after it's set.

For our exercise, we will define the following constants. You can copy and paste this into your code:

```{python}
API_BASE_URL = "https://api.dp.la/v2/" 
ENV_VAR_NAME = "DPLA_API_KEY" 
FALLBACK_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UCSB-Library-Research-Data-Services/intro2APIs/refs/heads/main/data/" 
```

## Storing Your API Key

Although technically this is not a public application, it's still good practice to keep your API key secure and avoid hardcoding it directly, to avoid accidentally sharing it with your code. We are going to store the API key as an **environment variable**, that is, a variable that lives in your system's environment rather than in your code. This way, you can access it in your code without exposing it directly.

[`getpass`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/getpass.html){target="_blank"} is a built-in Python module that provides a secure way to handle sensitive information, such as passwords or any other sensitive credentials.

The method we will use is as follows:

```{python}
#| eval: false
# Check if the API key is already set as an environment variable
api_key = os.getenv(ENV_VAR_NAME)

# If the API key is not set, a prompt will ask to enter the API key
if not api_key:
    api_key = getpass(f"Enter your DPLA API key: ").strip()
    if not api_key:
        raise ValueError("No API key provided")
    # Store the API key as an environment variable for the current session
    os.environ[ENV_VAR_NAME] = api_key

print(f"API key set in environment variable '{ENV_VAR_NAME}'")
```
```{python}
#| echo: false
print(f"API key is set in environment variable '{ENV_VAR_NAME}'")
```

:::{.callout-important appearance="simple" collapse="false"}
## Never print your API key
Note that we printed a message confirming that the API key is set, and the name of the environment variable where it's stored, but we did not print the API key itself. This is a crucial, particularly when working in Jupyter notebooks, where the output of cells is saved and can be accidentally shared. Always avoid printing sensitive information like API keys, even in development environments.
:::

### Test the API Key

To test that your API key is working, you can make a simple request to the DPLA API. You can copy and paste this code into a cell in your notebook:

```{python}
# Make a test request to the DPLA API
test_url = f"{API_BASE_URL}items?api_key={api_key}&page_size=1"
response = httpx.get(test_url)
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("API key is valid! Here's a sample response:")
    print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))
else:
    print(f"Failed to connect to the API. Status code: {response.status_code}")
    print(f"Response: {response.text}")
```

Having all the libraries in place and the API key securely stored, now it's time to do some queries!!
