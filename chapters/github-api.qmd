The GitHub API is a powerful tool for developers, researchers, and data analysts. It allows you to programmatically interact with almost every feature available on GitHub’s website — including repositories, issues, users, and more.

In this section, we’ll explore a curated set of endpoints from the GitHub REST API using Postman. We’ll build on what we learned in previous chapters: setting headers, using variables, and making `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` requests.

The only requirement to access most of GitHub’s API is an **authorization token**, which you can generate in your GitHub settings.

## Getting Your GitHub Authorization Token

To access private endpoints or perform actions like creating issues or repositories, GitHub requires an authorization token. This token acts like a password for your API requests, so keep it secret and secure.

Here’s how to generate one:

1. [Go to GitHub](https://github.com) and log into your account.
2. Navigate to your [Developer settings](https://github.com/settings/apps):
   - Click your profile photo (top right) → **Settings**
   - Scroll down to **Developer settings**
3. In the left sidebar, select **Personal access tokens** → then [**Tokens (classic)**](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
4. Click the **Generate new token** (classic) button.
5. Fill out the form:
   - **Note**: Give your token a descriptive name, e.g. `Postman Workshop Token`
   - **Expiration**: Choose any short duration (e.g. 7 or 30 days)
   - **Scopes**:
     - Check the box for **`repo`** → this includes issues, pull requests, and repo access
     - You can also select **`read:user`** and **`user:email`** if you want user info
6. Click **Generate token**

GitHub will only show the token **once**. Copy it immediately and save it somewhere secure (e.g., directly into Postman).

### Add It to Postman

1. Open your **GitHub environment** in Postman (or create one).
2. Add a **secret** variable:
   - **Variable**: `gh_token`
   - **Type**: `secret`
   - **Initial value**: *(paste your token here)*
   - **Current value**: will be filled automatically
3. Save the environment.

You’ll now be able to authorize your GitHub requests by including this header in each request:

`Authorization: Bearer {{gh_token}}`


Postman will automatically substitute `{{gh_token}}` with your real token, keeping it secure.
