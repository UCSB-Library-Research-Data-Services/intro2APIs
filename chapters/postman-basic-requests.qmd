In this section, we’ll create a workspace in Postman and perform a few basic `GET` requests using three public APIs: **The Cat API**, the [Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API](https://metmuseum.github.io/), and **GitHub**.

The screenshots in this notebook were taken from the **Postman Desktop application** running on macOS.

- **Version**: 11.42.1  
- **UI Version**: 11.42.1-ui-250421-2337  
- **Desktop Platform Version**: 11.41.4 (11.41.4)

While Postman's interface and features may continue to evolve (see the [release notes](https://www.postman.com/release-notes/postman-app/) for updates), the **core concepts covered in this guide will remain relevant** across future versions.

## Starting with a Workspace

**Workspaces** help keep your requests organized and make it easier to collaborate with others. To create a new workspace, go to `Workspaces` → `Create Workspace` and choose a **Blank workspace**.

You'll be prompted to enter a name, select a workspace type, and manage access settings.

For this exercise, we’ll use the following setup:

- **Name**: `My Requests`
- **Type**: `Internal workspace`
- **Access**: Keep the default — everyone in your team can access it

If you haven’t set up a team in Postman yet, you’ll be prompted to fill out a simple form to create one. Just keep it straightforward: choose any name for your team, select `Other` for the question *“What will your team work on?”*, and confirm.

Once your team is created, you’ll be ready to add some collections.
