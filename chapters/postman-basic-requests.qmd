In this section, we’ll create a workspace in Postman and perform a few basic `GET` requests using three public APIs: **The Cat API**, the [Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API](https://metmuseum.github.io/), and **GitHub**.

- **Version**: 11.42.1  
- **UI Version**: 11.42.1-ui-250421-2337  
- **Desktop Platform Version**: 11.41.4 (11.41.4)

While Postman's interface and features may continue to evolve (see the [release notes](https://www.postman.com/release-notes/postman-app/) for updates), the **core concepts covered in this guide will remain relevant** across future versions.

## Starting with a Workspace

**Workspaces** help keep your requests organized and make it easier to collaborate with others. To create a new workspace, go to `Workspaces` → `Create Workspace` and choose a **Blank workspace**.

You'll be prompted to enter a name, select a workspace type, and manage access settings.

For this exercise, we’ll use the following setup:

- **Name**: `My Requests`
- **Type**: `Internal workspace`
- **Access**: Keep the default — everyone in your team can access it

If you haven’t set up a team in Postman yet, you’ll be prompted to fill out a simple form to create one. Just keep it straightforward: choose any name for your team, select `Other` for the question *“What will your team work on?”*, and confirm.

Once your team is created, you’ll be ready to add some collections.

## Creating a Collection

Once your workspace and team are set up, the next step is to create a **collection**. Collections are folders that help you group and organize your API requests. They’re especially useful when working with multiple endpoints from the same service.

To create a new collection:

1. In the left sidebar, click the `Collections` tab.
2. Click the `+ Blank Collection` button.
3. Give your collection a name. For this exercise, you can name it **"The Cat API"**.
4. (Optional) Add a description to explain what this collection is for.
5. Click **Create**.

You’ll now see your new collection listed in the sidebar. We’ll add our first `GET` request to it in the next step.

::: {.callout-tip}
When you create a new workspace, Postman may automatically add a template collection named **"End-to-End Tests"**. You can safely remove it to keep your workspace clean and focused.

To delete it:  
Click the three dots (`⋮`) next to the collection name, then select **Delete**.

## Adding Your First `GET` Request

Now that you've created your collection, it's time to add a request. We’ll start by adding a basic `GET` request to **The Cat API** to retrieve a list of cat breeds.

To do this:

1. Click the name of your collection (**The Cat API**) in the left sidebar.
2. Click the three dots (`⋮`) next to the collection name, then select **Add request**.
3. Give your request a name — for example, **List Breeds**.
4. In the **Request type dropdown**, make sure `GET` is selected.
5. In the **URL field**, paste the following endpoint:  

https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/breeds

6. Click **Save** (upper right) and choose **Save to "The Cat API" collection**.

You’re ready to send your first request! Click the **Send** button.

You should see a `200 OK` response along with a list of cat breeds in the response body.
