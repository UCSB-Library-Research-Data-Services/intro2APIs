Now it’s time to interact with one of the most common features of GitHub: **issues**. You’ll create, update, list, and (sort of) delete an issue — all using the GitHub API.

## Preparing Your Repository

To complete this exercise, you’ll need a repository that **you own** (not one you just contribute to). If you don’t already have one, go to GitHub and create a new, empty repository.

You can name it something like `api-test-repo` or `postman-playground`.

## Setting Environment Variables

Let’s make this exercise easier to repeat and reuse. In your **GitHub Postman environment**, add two **default** variables:

- **`owner`** → your GitHub username  
- **`repo`** → the name of your target repository

Now you can reuse them like this:  
`{{gh_URL}}/repos/{{owner}}/{{repo}}/issues`

## Create a New Issue

- **Method**: `POST`  
- **Endpoint**:
  ```
  {{gh_URL}}/repos/{{owner}}/{{repo}}/issues
  ```
- **Headers**:
  - `Authorization`: `Bearer {{gh_token}}`
  - `accept`: `application/vnd.github+json`
- **Body (raw, JSON)**:
  ```json
  {
  "title": "API-created issue",
  "body": "This issue was created using Postman!"
  }
  ```

Click **Send**. If successful, you’ll receive a `201 Created` response with the new issue’s details.

📌 **Save the `number` of the issue** from the response — you'll need it in the next step.

## Update the Issue

- **Method**: `PATCH`
- **Endpoint**:
  ```
  {{gh_URL}}/repos/{{owner}}/{{repo}}/issues/{issue_number}
  ```
  Replace `{issue_number}` with the number from Step 1.

- **Headers**: same as before
- **Body (raw, JSON)**:
  ```json
  {
  "title": "Updated title from Postman",
  "body": "This issue has been updated via PATCH request!"
  }
  ```

You should receive a `200 OK` response with the updated issue content.

## List Issues in Your Repository

- **Method**: `GET`
- **Endpoint**:
  ```
  {{gh_URL}}/repos/{{owner}}/{{repo}}/issues
  ```

This request returns all open issues in your repository, including the one you just created.

## "Delete" the Issue (Unlock)

GitHub doesn’t allow true issue deletion via the API. However, you can simulate deletion in two ways:
- **Close** the issue (optional)
- **Unlock** it — which removes any restriction on further edits

Let’s unlock it:

- **Method**: `DELETE`
- **Endpoint**:
  ```
  {{gh_URL}}/repos/{{owner}}/{{repo}}/issues/{issue_number}/lock
  ```

If successful, you’ll receive a `204 No Content` response.

## Summary

By completing these steps, you've now:

- Created and updated GitHub content using `POST` and `PATCH`
- Retrieved structured issue data with `GET`
- Performed a partial deletion (unlock) with `DELETE`

You're now ready to apply what you’ve learned to real project workflows, automation tasks, or your next API-powered integration.
