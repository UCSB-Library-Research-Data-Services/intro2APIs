In this section, we’ll create a workspace in Postman and perform a few basic `GET` requests using **The Cat API**.

The screenshots in this notebook were taken from the **Postman Desktop application** running on macOS.

- **Version**: 11.42.1  
- **UI Version**: 11.42.1-ui-250421-2337  
- **Desktop Platform Version**: 11.41.4 (11.41.4)

While Postman's interface and features may continue to evolve (see the [release notes](https://www.postman.com/release-notes/postman-app/) for updates), the **core concepts covered in this guide will remain relevant** across future versions.

## Starting with a Workspace

**Workspaces** help keep your requests organized and make it easier to collaborate with others. To create a new workspace, go to `Workspaces` → `Create Workspace` and choose a **Blank workspace**.

You'll be prompted to enter a name, select a workspace type, and manage access settings.

For this exercise, we’ll use the following setup:

- **Name**: `My Requests`
- **Type**: `Internal workspace`
- **Access**: Keep the default — everyone in your team can access it

If you haven’t set up a team in Postman yet, you’ll be prompted to fill out a simple form to create one. Just keep it straightforward: choose any name for your team, select `Other` for the question *“What will your team work on?”*, and confirm.

Once your team is created, you’ll be ready to add some collections.

## Creating a Collection

Once your workspace and team are set up, the next step is to create a **collection**. Collections are folders that help you group and organize your API requests. They’re especially useful when working with multiple endpoints from the same service.

To create a new collection:

1. In the left sidebar, click the `Collections` tab.
2. Click the `+ Blank Collection` button.
3. Give your collection a name. For this exercise, you can name it **"The Cat API"**.
4. (Optional) Add a description to explain what this collection is for.
5. Click **Create**.

You’ll now see your new collection listed in the sidebar. We’ll add our first `GET` request to it in the next step.

When you create a new workspace, Postman may automatically add a template collection named **"End-to-End Tests"**. You can safely remove it to keep your workspace clean and focused.

To delete it:  
Click the three dots (`⋮`) next to the collection name, then select **Delete**.

## Adding Your First `GET` Request

Now that you've created your collection, it's time to add a request. We’ll start by adding a basic `GET` request to **The Cat API** to retrieve a list of cat breeds.

To do this:

1. Click the name of your collection (**The Cat API**) in the left sidebar.
2. Click the three dots (`⋮`) next to the collection name, then select **Add request**.
3. Give your request a name — for example, **List Breeds**.
4. In the **Request type dropdown**, make sure `GET` is selected.
5. In the **URL field**, paste the following endpoint:  

`https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/breeds`

6. Click **Save** (upper right) and choose **Save to "The Cat API" collection**.

You’re ready to send your first request! Click the **Send** button.

You should see a `200 OK` response along with a list of cat breeds in the response body.

## Using Query Parameters

Many APIs allow you to filter or customize your results using **query parameters**. These are added to the end of the URL after a `?` symbol and follow a `key=value` format.

Let’s try an example using The Cat API’s search endpoint to retrieve only a few cat images in GIF format.

1. In your **The Cat API** collection, add a new request.
2. Name the request: **Search Cat Images**
3. Set the request type to `GET`.
4. In the URL field, paste the following:

`https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search`

5. Switch to the **Params** tab (below the URL field).
6. Add the following query parameters:

| Key         | Value     |
|--------------|-----------|
| `mime_types` | `gif`     |
| `limit`      | `3`       |
| `size`       | `small`   |

7. Click **Send** to execute the request.

You should see a list of cat image objects, each with a `url` field pointing to a different cat GIF.

---

If you look carefully at the response, you’ll notice that it returns 10 elements instead of the 3 we specified in the `limit` parameter. This is because that parameter only works for **authenticated users**.

The reason is simple: while you can request fewer items (like 3), you can also ask for much larger amounts—such as 20 or even 100 images. If anyone could do this without limits (for example, a bot), The Cat API’s resources could be overwhelmed very quickly.

That’s why even seemingly harmless actions often require some form of **access control** to prevent abuse or unintended behavior.

In the next section, we’ll explore how authentication works and how Postman can help you manage your credentials securely.
