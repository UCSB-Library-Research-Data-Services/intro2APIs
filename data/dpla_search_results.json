The mechanical technology that powered the device was fraudulent; the cabinetry housing the \"machine\" instead housed human players. During the time Ajeeb was active, his role was played by chess players Harry Nelson Pillsbury (1898\u20131904), Albert Beauregard Hodges, Constant Ferdinand Burille, Charles Moehle, and Charles Francis Barker.",

The 'thinking machines' are calculating devices developed by a Burbank concern, Librascope, Inc., to perform tasks ranging from forecasting weather and matching color to relatively 'simple' problems like instantaneous multiplication. One of the machines designed at the plant at 133 E. Santa Anita Ave. is the 'automatic tristimulus integrator.' It can solve a problem in color analysis in a fraction of the time a staff of experts would require.\" Pictured is Lewis W. Imm, creator of 'thinking machines.'",
