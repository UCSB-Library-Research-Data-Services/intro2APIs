We have included some interactive examples in the workbook, so you can follow along with the workshop.\n\nAlthough you don't need any particular software or programming language to follow the lessons, you can look at the code that is used to generate the examples by clicking in the `Code` button, like in the example below:\n\n\n\n\n\n```{ojs}\n\nviewof code = input.code(\n  value = \"\n\n\n  ::: {#4d21a6ab .cell execution_count=1}\n  ``` {.python .cell-code}\n  print('Hello, world!')\n  ```\n  \n  ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n  ```\n  Hello, world!\n  ```\n  :::\n  :::\n  \n  \n  \",\n  type = \"text\"\n)\n\ncode;\n```\n\n",
